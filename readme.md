# Urdu Chatbot

An AI-powered conversational agent designed to understand and respond in Urdu language. Built using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, this chatbot can handle basic conversations.

## Overview

## Key Features

- **Urdu Language Support**: Processes and responds in Urdu script with proper encoding
- **Conversational AI**: Handles greetings, questions, and simple dialogues naturally
- **Lightweight Design**: Runs on minimal dependencies for quick setup and deployment
- **Customizable Responses**: Edit training data and intents to match your use case
